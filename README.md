## Challenge
### It's really callenge to code it from the Hi-Fi that I designed. The padding, margin, and font-size that I used in Figma are way too large, so I need to find those are more suitable which took a while. I also changed the contact page design because it's way too small on iPad screen size. More than that, I changed the home page's images because I like the version that i use instead of Figma's and the logo size on mobile screen because it was too small. I also changed the about page's images, my potrait was way too large and the second image was too long for the desktop. 

## What I have learned. 
### It's a cool thing that we could design our own website and also can used that we have learned about UX design, Bootstrap, Illustration, and images. It's way easier to use Bootstrap to code it. You are my favourite Friday night teacher. I really learned a lot during your class. Hope you have a wonderful summer.
