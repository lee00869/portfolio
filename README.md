## Challenge
Crafting and coding the website from the Hi-Fi prototype I designed presented its challenges. The padding, margin, and font sizes I selected in Figma turned out to be excessively large, necessitating a search for more suitable options. Additionally, I revamped the contact page layout to better accommodate iPad screens, and replaced home page images with ones I preferred. Adjustments were made to the logo size for mobile screens and the proportions of images on the about page. Lastly, I opted for the Bootstrap hamburger menu over my custom design for practicality. These refinements aimed to enhance both aesthetics and usability.

## What I have learned
It's fascinating how we can design our own website while implementing what we've learned about UX design, Bootstrap, illustration, and responsive images. Utilizing Bootstrap for coding significantly streamlines the process. I'm delighted that you've found my teaching beneficial, especially during our Friday night classes. I'm thrilled to hear you've learned a lot. Wishing you a fantastic summer ahead!
